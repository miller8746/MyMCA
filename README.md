Setting Up a Development Environment
------------------------------------
Follow [these](https://vuejs.org/guide/quick-start.html) instructions to set up and run a local development environment.  Part of the installation process requires installing Node.js, which may require some restarts or changes in administrative permissions.  After you have the requirements installed, you can start a local server by using the instructions on the same page.
