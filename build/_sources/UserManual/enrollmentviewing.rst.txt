Viewing your Enrollments
========================

After you have signed up for programs, you will be able to see them from within the MyMCA application.  If you have not yet signed up for a program, see :doc:`program`. Continue reading for instructions on how to see your current program enrollments.

1. If you have not done so already, sign into your account using your login information.  See :doc:`accountcreation` and :doc:`login` for more details.

2. At the top of the application, click the "Enrollments" link.
